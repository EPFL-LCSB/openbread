### PMES ###
This is the particle based multiscale enzyme simlator environment. 

The software package enables to run multiscale simulations of enzymatic systems. 
We use hard sphere brownian dynamics simulation to find the filter descriptions 
for collisions and dissociations. 




Don't forget to edit the run.sh/run.bat to reflect the path to a
directory in which the work/ folder is present

1. Install Docker (docker pull openfpm/0.8.0)
2. In a terminal:

	```bash
	./build
	./run
	```

3. Enjoy :)
